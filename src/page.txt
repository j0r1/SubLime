SubLime
=======

SubLime is a tool to overlay subtitles loaded from an [SRT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip#SubRip_text_file_format)
file over an HTML5 video element in your browser. It is available as a
 
 - bookmarklet: <a href="javascript:void(0)" id="bookmarkletlink">SubLimeLet</a>
 - extension for the Chrome browser: [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sublime/mfbmioaibkokjaddfppfcpnpcbjhlomo)

It is known to work with [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/), [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com)
and [vimeo](https://vimeo.com/) videos (if HTML5 video is used).

Subtitle sync
-------------
In case the subtitles from your file are not well synchronized to the time of the
video, you can resync them in a number of ways. Let's call `v` the video time and
`s` the subtitle time, then a time offset `o` and time scale factor `f` can be
set. For a specific video time `v`, the corresponding time looked for in the
subtitle file is then

	s(v) = v/f+o

Alternatively, the subtitle time `s` will be shown at video time

	v(s) = (s-o)*f

The values of `o` and `f` can be set directly, or can be calculated by matching the
subtitles to the video at two times, pressing 'k' and 'l' respectively at each time.

Default key bindings
------------
 - '+' or 'f': add 100ms to the subtitle offset `o`
 - '-' or 'd': subtract 100ms from the subtitle offset `o`
 - '*' or 'g': set the subtitle time offset `o`
 - '/' or 'h': set the subtitle time rescale factor `f`
 - 'k' or 'c': set first sync calculation point
 - 'l' or 'v': set second sync calculation point
 - 'o': open another subtitle file
 - 's': save the current (possibly re-synced) subtitles to a file
 - 'Alt' + 'p': open preferences dialog

Except for the key to open the preferences dialog, all key bindings are 
configurable.

Full screen problems
--------------------
Because the subtitle text is simply shown as an overlay over the video, the subtitles
will most likely disappear when clicking the button to show the video full screen. I'm
not aware for a solution that always works for this, the best solution is probably to
make the browser window itself as large as possible (e.g. by pressing F11 or going to
'Presentation Mode').

Used software
-------------

 - [JQuery]( http://jquery.com/ ) to make life easier
 - [Vex]( http://github.hubspot.com/vex/docs/welcome/ ) for nice dialogs
 - SRT parsing based on [jquery.srt.js]( http://v2v.cc/~j/jquery.srt/ )
 - [FileSaver.js]( https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/ ) to be able to save subtitles to a file
